## Demo app

Streamlit App

## Code

Here's how to use st.checkbox:

```
import streamlit as st

st.header('st.checkbox')

st.write ('What would you like to order?')

icecream = st.checkbox('Ice cream')
coffee = st.checkbox('Coffee')
cola = st.checkbox('Cola')

if icecream:
     st.write("Great! Here's some more üç¶")

if coffee: 
     st.write("Okay, here's some coffee ‚òï")

if cola:
     st.write("Here you go ü•§")
```
## Line-by-line explanation

The very first thing to do when creating a Streamlit app is to start by importing the streamlit library as st like so:

```
import streamlit as st
```
This is followed by creating a header text for the app:

```
st.header('st.checkbox')
```
Next, we're going to ask a question via 'st.write':

```
st.write ('What would you like to order?')
```
We're then going to provide some menu items to tick on:

```
icecream = st.checkbox('Ice cream')
coffee = st.checkbox('Coffee')
cola = st.checkbox('Cola')
```
Finally, we're going to print custom text depending on which checkbox was ticked on:

```
if icecream:
     st.write("Great! Here's some more üç¶")

if coffee: 
     st.write("Okay, here's some coffee ‚òï")

if cola:
     st.write("Here you go ü•§")
```
